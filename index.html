      <h2>Choosing the Right Personalised Leather Gift</h2>
      <p>When selecting a personalised leather gift, it’s important to consider the recipient’s lifestyle and preferences. Here are a few tips to guide your decision:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consider Their Needs:</strong> Does the recipient travel often? A personalised leather luggage tag might be perfect. Do they work in an office? A custom leather notebook or cardholder would be ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Think About Their Style:</strong> Choose a leather item that suits their personal taste. If they prefer minimalist designs, opt for a sleek, unembellished wallet or keychain. If they love bold, standout items, go for a larger bag or custom journal.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Meaningful Personalisation:</strong> The beauty of personalised gifts lies in the message they carry. Choose a meaningful engraving—whether it’s a monogram, a special date, or an inspirational quote—that reflects the recipient’s personality or the bond you share.</li>
